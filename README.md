# UP_DOWN-Analysis
Code for analysing up and down states in LFP during optogenetic stimulation of different cell lines.

Using cre- driven expression of channelrhodopsin, specific cell lines could be activated during recordings with a 16 channel linear electrode array in anaesthetised mice. This program was written to determine whether measured UP-states were driven by the optogenetic stimulation or if they were spontaneous, endogenous UP-states.
